Unofficial documentation of the HonoX, by HonoX users, for HonoX users.
I know that HonoX documentation has not been created because the API is not stable at the alpha stage. I started this project to make HonoX more accessible and easy to try.
PR is welcome.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install

To run:
